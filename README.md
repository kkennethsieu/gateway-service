# 🌐 Game Review API Gateway

**API Gateway microservice for the Game Review Platform**  
Routes requests to the appropriate microservices (User, Review, Game Catalog, Likes) and enriches responses with related data.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

This service acts as a **single entry point** for the frontend to interact with multiple backend services. It fetches, combines, and returns data from the following microservices:

- **User Service** – fetch user info
- **Review Service** – fetch reviews
- **Game Catalog Service** – fetch game details
- **Likes Service** – fetch like/dislike counts

**Tech Stack:**  
Node.js, Express, CORS, Docker

## ⚠️ Notes

CORS is configured to allow requests from http://localhost:5173 (frontend).

Cache Example: A simple in-memory cache (Map) is included.

Ensure all microservices are accessible at the URLs configured in the service constants or via Docker network.

## 🐳 Docker

When running inside Docker, the gateway uses service names for internal communication:

```javascript
const USER_SERVICE = process.env.USER_SERVICE || "http://localhost:3001";
const REVIEW_SERVICE = process.env.REVIEW_SERVICE || "http://localhost:3002";
const CATALOG_SERVICE = process.env.CATALOG_SERVICE || "http://localhost:3003";
const LIKES_SERVICE = process.env.LIKES_SERVICE || "http://localhost:3004";
```

The gateway service should be included in the same Docker network as all other microservices.

## 🔹 Example Request from Frontend

```javascript
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/user/3/reviews-with-games");
const reviews = await response.json();
console.log(reviews);
```
